    <h1>Hello, I'm Ng Zhi Xin</h1>
    <p>
      I am passionate about the Hospitality & Tourism industry and would like to apply for the 
      <strong>Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) Hospitality & Tourism Management Programme</strong>. 
      My goal is to deepen my understanding and knowledge, especially in modules such as 
      <em>Fundamentals in the Hospitality Environment</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      From my research, I discovered that NYP offers students practical experiences, including 
      opportunities to understand how to manage a business and develop marketing skills — 
      essential aspects for anyone aspiring to work in this dynamic field.
    </p>

    <p>
      During my time at ITE College East, I appreciated the knowledge provided, 
      but I believe it’s only the beginning. To truly advance, I need a broader and deeper 
      education that NYP can offer.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Technology and Business may seem like separate fields, they are deeply connected.
      Without technology, online businesses would struggle to operate and promote digital campaigns.
      I want to explore these intersections to stay ahead in the hospitality industry.
